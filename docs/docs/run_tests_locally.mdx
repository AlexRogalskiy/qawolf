In the [previous guide](create_a_test) we created our first browser test for [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react). We will now run our test locally to verify that it works.

## TL;DR

- [Run a specific test](#run-a-test-locally) on Chromium browser:

```bash
npx qawolf test myTestName
```

- [Run all tests](#run-all-tests-locally) on [specified browser(s)](#testing-across-browsers):

<BrowserCodeBlock />

## Run a test locally

Let's run our test to confirm it works locally. In the command line, run the following [command](TODOFIXLINK). If applicable, replace `myFirstTest` with your test name.

```bash
npx qawolf test myFirstTest
```

By default, QA Wolf tests run on the [Chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home). After running this command, a Chromium browser will open and the test will run. See the video below for an example.

If you're having trouble running your test, please [chat with us](https://gitter.im/qawolf/community) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/issues/new)!

## Run all tests locally

To run all of your tests locally, run:

```bash
npx qawolf test
```

By default, QA Wolf tests run on the [Chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home). After running this command, your tests will run in parallel to the extent possible. Each test will run on a separate Chromium browser.

If you prefer to run your tests sequentially, you can use the [`--runInBand` Jest flag](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--runinband):

```bash
npx qawolf test --runInBand
```

## Testing across browsers

QA Wolf is built on top of Microsoft's [Playwright library](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), which automates the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new), and [WebKit](https://webkit.org) browsers with a single API. You can therefore run your tests on any of the supported browsers without having to change your code.

Chromium is an open source browser that forms the basis for the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome). Similarly, Webkit is the browser engine used in the [Safari browser](https://www.apple.com/safari). In the majority of cases, you can consider running tests on Chromium as functionally equivalent to running them on Chrome. This is also true for WebKit and Safari. TODOJON

To run your tests on a specific browser, use the `--chromium`, `--firefox`, or `--webkit` [flags](TODOFIXLINK). If no flag is provided, QA Wolf will default to running your tests on Chromium.

<BrowserSpecificCodeBlock />

You can also run your tests on all browsers with the `--all-browsers` [flag](TODOFIXLINK). This will run each test three times: once on Chromium, once on Firefox, and once on WebKit.

```bash
npx qawolf test --all-browsers
```

The browser flags work the same way if you want to run a specific test:

```bash
npx qawolf test myTestName --all-browsers
```

## Next steps

Congratulations - you've mastered the basics of creating and running browser tests! üéâ

There are a few places you can go from here:

- [Run your tests in CI](run_tests_in_ci)
- Learn how to edit your test code:
  - [Use the REPL](use_the_repl)
  - [Add assertions](add_assertions)
  - [Use custom selectors](use_custom_selectors)
  - [Change input values](change_input_values)
