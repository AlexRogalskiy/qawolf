## Why did we build QA Wolf?

We built QA Wolf to make our lives easier, and we hope you find it useful too. We have experienced the pain of setting up browser tests for consulting clients and previous employers. By generating [editable code](edit_test_code) from browser actions, we significantly reduce the time needed to write or maintain tests. We constantly stress test QA Wolf against different sites to get closer to that goal. Please reach out on our [chat](https://gitter.im/qawolf/community) if you have any feedback or requests!

## Why not [some other recorder]?

We found the open source recorders brittle and limited in their functionality. They are brittle because they rely on specific attributes and do not auto-wait for elements/assertions. They are limited in their functionality because they do not configure CI, do not include debugging artifacts (videos, DOM, logs), or do not work for various scenarios (multiple tabs, keyboard shortcuts, etc).

We are philosophically opposed to closed-source test recorders and proprietary test frameworks. We believe that if you put in the work to create your tests, you should own them, be able to edit them as you like, and be able to run them on your own infrastructure.

## Why Playwright over Selenium?

We found Playwright to be more stable than Selenium in practice and we're not [the](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/improving-end-to-end-testing-at-coursera-using-playwright-and-jest-5f1bac9cd176) [only](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20505711) [ones](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20506053).

Playwright offers additional functionality we take advantage of, like [evaluating a script on a new document](https://github.com/playwright/playwright/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#pageevaluateonnewdocumentpagefunction-args) and [creating a callback to the server](https://github.com/playwright/playwright/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#pageexposefunctionname-playwrightfunction). While these are possible to reimplement, we want to spend our time creating a better end-to-end experience.

This is a tough call because Selenium has been around for so long, and has the most cross-browser support. Ultimately we decided to prioritize stability over everything else, since that has been our major pain point with browser automation in the past.

## Why Playwright over Cypress?

We think Cypress is really cool! However they [intentionally](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs.html#Automation-restrictions) built it for sites you control, not third party sites. This limitation prevents scripting third party sites, a [major feature](quick_start#-create-a-browser-script) of QA Wolf.

This combined with the [one window](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs.html#Multiple-tabs) limitation, also prevents testing use cases we encounter in the wild (sign in with Twitter, CRM Integration, etc).

Why not stub out those situations? You still can - just edit the generated Playwright and Jest test code! However, stubbing requires a time and maintenance investment that we wanted to be able to opt out of. We leave it to you to stub or not stub as you like.

By running our [@qawolf/web](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/web) code in the browser we get the best of Cypress (fast in the browser) and [Playwright](https://pptr.dev/)/[DevTools](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) (rich APIs and well-supported DevTools protocol).

## Can you support [some other framework]?

You can already [edit your code](edit_test_code) to use any node package or framework.

In terms of generating the browser code for a framework other than [Playwright](https://pptr.dev/), or testing code for a framework other than [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), we would consider it to create a better experience for the community. If you have a framework you'd like us to support, please [chat](https://gitter.im/qawolf/community) or [email](mailto:jon@qawolf.com) us!
