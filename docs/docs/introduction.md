Hi there, thanks for checking out QA Wolf! 🐺

QA Wolf is an [open source](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf) library for creating browser tests and scripts 10x faster. It converts your browser actions to stable [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) code, including [automatic waiting](review_test_code#automatic-waiting) and [smart element selectors](review_test_code#element-selectors). It also sets up CI in one command to upload a video, GIF, and detailed logs for each test.

This series of tutorials provides a detailed walkthrough of how to use QA Wolf. If you prefer to jump right in, see our [Quick Start](quick_start).

We want QA Wolf to work for you, so please [chat with us](https://gitter.im/qawolf/community) or [e-mail us](mailto:jon@qawolf.com) if you have any questions or feedback!
