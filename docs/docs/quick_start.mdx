QA Wolf is an [open source](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf) library for creating browser tests and scripts 10x faster. It converts your browser actions to stable [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) code, including [automatic waiting](how_it_works#-automatic-waiting) and [smart element selectors](how_it_works#-element-selectors). It also sets up CI in one command to upload a video, GIF, and detailed logs for each test.

Below is a quick start guide for developers. For a more detailed walkthrough of how to get started with QA Wolf, [see our tutorial](introduction).

## üñ•Ô∏è Install QA Wolf

Install QA Wolf as a dev dependency with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
cd /my/awesome/project
npm install --save-dev qawolf
```

## ‚úÖ Record a browser test

```bash
npx qawolf record <url> [name]
```

This will open a Chromium browser where your actions will be recorded. If a name is not provided, the test name will default to the URL hostname.

When you are done, press enter in the CLI to save your test:

```bash
? Save [Y/n]
```

The test will be stored in a `.qawolf` folder.

```bash
.qawolf # current directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myTest.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectors
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myTest.json
```

The `.qawolf/tests/myTest.test.js` file contains [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io) code that you can [edit](edit_your_code). The `.qawolf/selectors/myTest.json` file contains the test [element selectors](how_it_works#-element-selectors).

Run your test:

```bash
qawolf test [name]
```

If you provide an incorrect name, you will be asked to choose from a list of your tests.

## ü§ñ Record a browser script

```bash
npx qawolf record --script <url> [name]
```

This will open a Chromium browser where your actions will be recorded. If a name is not provided, the script name will default to the URL hostname.

When you are done, press enter in the CLI to save your script:

```bash
? Save [Y/n]
```

The script will be stored in a `.qawolf` folder.

```bash
.qawolf # current directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myScript.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectors
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myScript.json
```

The `.qawolf/scripts/myScript.js` file contains [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) code that you can [edit](edit_your_code). The `.qawolf/selectors/myScript.json` file contains the script element selectors.

Run your script:

```bash
node .qawolf/scripts/name.js
```
