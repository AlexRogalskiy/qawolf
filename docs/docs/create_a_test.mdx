<br/>


The [previous guide](install) showed you how to set up your environment and install QA Wolf. In this guide, we create a test with assertions for [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react), a simple todo application.

Now let's create your first browser test!


## Create a test

To create your test, run this command:

```bash
npx qawolf create http://todomvc.com/examples/react myTest
```

:::tip

You can replace `http://todomvc.com/examples/react` with a different URL and `myTest` with a different test name. See the [CLI documentation](api/cli#npx-qawolf-create-url-name) for more details.

:::

A Chromium browser will open and navigate to the specified URL. After the page has loaded and QA Wolf can access it, you will see the following in the command line:

```bash
🐺 QA Wolf is ready to create code!
```

Now go through the steps you want to test. In our example, we 1) create a todo item, 2) complete it, and 3) clear completed todos. These actions will be converted to [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test code. 

See the video below for an example:

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KP4tpilrOOE" />

## Review the code

You'll notice that a folder called `.qawolf` was created in your project. This folder stores your QA Wolf tests and has the following structure:

```bash
.qawolf # project directory
├── myTest.test.js
├── selectors
│   └── myTest.json
```

Let's open the `.qawolf/myTest.test.js` file, which contains your test code. We'll explain the `.qawolf/selectors/myTest.json` file a bit later.

### Imports

The test requires the `qawolf` library, which is built on top of [Microsoft's Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library. It also requires the selectors file, which we'll get to later:

```js
const qawolf = require('qawolf');
const selectors = require('./selectors/myTest.json');
```

### beforeAll

To start your test, a few things happen in the [Jest `beforeAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#beforeallfn-timeout). The test launches a [browser](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-browser) and creates a new [context](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-browsercontext), which is an "incognito" browser session. This context is passed to the [`qawolf.register` method](api/qawolf/register) so QA Wolf can access it. Finally, a new [page](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-page) is created:

```js
let browser;
let page;

beforeAll(async () => {
  browser = await qawolf.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  await qawolf.register(context);
  page = await context.newPage();
});
```

### test

The test itself is contained in a [Jest `test` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testname-fn-timeout) with the name you specified (`"myTest"` in our example). The test first navigates to the specified URL. Then it repeats the actions that you took. In our case, it clicks the todo input, types `create test!`, presses Enter, clicks to complete the todo, and clicks the clear completed todos button:

```js
test('myTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click(selectors['0_what_needs_to_b_input']);
  await page.type(selectors['1_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'create test!');
  await page.press(selectors['2_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'Enter');
  await page.click(selectors['3_input']);
  await page.click(selectors['4_button']);
  await qawolf.create();
});
```

The line `await qawolf.create();` at the end of your test is a placeholder for where new test code will be added if you continue to use the browser. This allows you to optionally edit your test code as you go along. When you finish creating a test, this line is removed.

### afterAll

After the test finishes running, the browser is closed in the [Jest `afterAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#afterallfn-timeout). If a video of your test is being recorded, the recording stops and the video is saved.

```js
afterAll(async () => {
  await qawolf.stopVideos();
  await browser.close();
});
```

### Selectors file

QA Wolf will inline a CSS Selector whenever it finds a [test attribute](use_custom_selectors#target-attributes) like `data-qa`.Otherwise it falls back to creating a default selector, stored in `.qawolf/selectors/myTest.json`. 

The `.qawolf/selectors/myTest.json` file contains information about each element that you interacted with (such as clicked or typed into). By default, QA Wolf stores all the [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) of each element and its two direct ancestors. By using all the information it can to find an element, QA Wolf helps make your test code robust to changes in your application.

:::caution 

Instead of editing the selectors file, you should add test attributes to your elements when possible. See the [custom selectors guide](use_custom_selectors#add-test-attributes-to-application-code) for more details.

:::

## Edit as you go

The test code is created in real-time, so you can edit the test as you create it. When you save the test file, QA Wolf will re-run the test.

:::tip

- You can disable watch mode in [qawolf.config.js](api/config#watch) and the test will not re-run on save.
- You can comment out/in `await qawolf.create();` to turn code creation off/on.
- You can move `await qawolf.create();` anywhere in your test.

:::

## Add assertions

Let's add assertions to our test.

We recommend adding assertions with the [expect-playwright library](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright), which automatically waits for assertions. QA Wolf includes this library by default, so you do not need to install anything to use it.

### Assert that text appears

The first assertion we will add is to check that the text `"Clear completed"` appears after we complete our todo. Specifically, we will call expect-playwright's [`toHaveText` method](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright#tohavetext) to verify that the text appears on the page.

In our test code, let's add a line to assert that the text `"Clear completed"` appears on the page:

```js
// ...

test('myTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click(selectors['0_what_needs_to_b_input']);
  await page.type(selectors['1_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'create test!');
  await page.press(selectors['2_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'Enter');
  await page.click(selectors['3_input']);
  // custom code starts
  await expect(page).toHaveText('Clear completed');
  // custom code ends
  await page.click(selectors['4_button']);
});
```

### Assert that an element appears

Next we'll add an assertion that our todo is no longer visible after we clear completed todos. In terms of the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), this means that there should be no todo `li` elements under the todo `ul` with the [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) `"todo-list"`.

We'll use the [`toHaveSelector` method](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright#toHaveSelector) to assert that the CSS selector `".todo-list li"` does not appear on the page after we clear completed todos.

Our test now looks like this:

```js
// ...

test('myFirstTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click(selectors['0_what_needs_to_b_input']);
  await page.type(selectors['1_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'create test!');
  await page.press(selectors['2_what_needs_to_b_input'], 'Enter');
  await page.click(selectors['3_input']);
  // custom code starts
  await expect(page).toHaveText('Clear completed');
  // custom code ends
  await page.click(selectors['4_button']);
  // custom code starts
  await expect(page).not.toHaveSelector('.todo-list li');
  // custom code ends
});
```

If the todo item did not disappear from the page, our test would fail.

## Save a test

Now let's return to the command line. You'll notice a few options here:

- `💾 Save and Exit`: saves your test code and closes the browser
- `🖥️ Open REPL to run code`: opens the [QA Wolf interactive REPL](use_the_repl) so you can try out code
- `🗑️ Discard and Exit`: closes the browser without saving your test code

Use the up and down arrow keys to choose between options. The default is `💾 Save and Exit`. Highlight this option and press `Enter` to save your test.

## Next steps

Congratulations - you just created your first test with QA Wolf! 🎉

Now let's [run our test locally](run_tests_locally).
