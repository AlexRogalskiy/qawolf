:::tip TL;DR

- [Create a test](#create-a-test) by running this command in your project directory:

```bash
npx qawolf create http://todomvc.com/examples/react myTest
```

- [Add assertions](#optional-add-assertions) with the [expect-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright) library (included with QA Wolf):

```js
await expect(page).toHaveText('Clear completed');
await expect(page).toHaveSelector('.clear-completed');
```

- [Save your test](#save-a-test) by choosing `💾 Save and Exit` in the command line

<br />

The [previous guide](install) showed you how to set up your environment and install QA Wolf. In this guide, we create a test with assertions for [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react), a simple todo application.

Now let's create your first browser test!

## Create a test

To create your test, run this command:

```bash
npx qawolf create http://todomvc.com/examples/react myTest
```

:::tip

You can replace `http://todomvc.com/examples/react` with a different URL and `myTest` with a different test name. See the [CLI documentation](api/cli#npx-qawolf-create-url-name) for more details.

:::

A Chromium browser will open and navigate to the specified URL. After the page has loaded and QA Wolf can access it, you will see the following in the command line:

```bash
🐺 QA Wolf is ready to create code!
```

Now go through the steps you want to test. In our example, we 1) create a todo item, 2) complete it, and 3) clear completed todos. These actions will be converted to [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test code.

See the video below for an example:

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9B3s-FIyso8" />

## Review the code

You'll notice that a folder called `.qawolf` was created in your project. This folder stores your QA Wolf tests, and should contain your test file `myTest.test.js`. Let's open the `.qawolf/myTest.test.js` file and review the test code.

### Imports

The test first requires the `qawolf` library, which is built on top of [Microsoft's Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library:

```js
const qawolf = require('qawolf');
```

### beforeAll

To start your test, a few things happen in the [Jest `beforeAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#beforeallfn-timeout). The test launches a [browser](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-browser) and creates a new [context](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-browsercontext), which is an "incognito" browser session. This context is passed to the [`qawolf.register` method](api/qawolf/register) so QA Wolf can access it. Finally, a new [page](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-page) is created:

```js
let browser;
let page;

beforeAll(async () => {
  browser = await qawolf.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  await qawolf.register(context);
  page = await context.newPage();
});
```

### afterAll

After the test finishes running, the browser is closed in the [Jest `afterAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#afterallfn-timeout). If a video of your test is being recorded, the recording stops and the video is saved.

```js
afterAll(async () => {
  await qawolf.stopVideos();
  await browser.close();
});
```

### test

The test itself is contained in a [Jest `test` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testname-fn-timeout) with the name you specified (`"myTest"` in our example). The test first navigates to the specified URL. Then it repeats the actions that you took. In our case, it clicks the todo input, types `create test!`, presses Enter, clicks to complete the todo, and clicks the clear completed todos button:

```js
test('myTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]');
  await page.type('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'create test!');
  await page.press('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'Enter');
  await page.click('.toggle');
  await page.click('text=Clear completed');
});
```

The line `await qawolf.create();` at the end of your test is a placeholder for where new test code will be added if you continue to use the browser. This allows you to optionally edit your test code as you go along. When you finish creating a test, this line is removed.

## Edit as you go

The test code is created in real-time, so you can edit the test as you create it.

:::tip

- You can move `await qawolf.create();` anywhere in your test

## Optional: Add assertions

Let's add assertions to our test.

We recommend adding assertions with the [expect-playwright library](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright), which automatically waits for assertions. QA Wolf includes this library by default, so you do not need to install anything to use it.

### Assert that text appears

The first assertion we will add is to check that the text `"Clear completed"` appears after we complete our todo. Specifically, we will call expect-playwright's [`toHaveText` method](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright#tohavetext) to verify that the text appears on the page.

In our test code, let's add a line to assert that the text `"Clear completed"` appears on the page:

```js
// ...

test('myTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]');
  await page.type('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'create test!');
  await page.press('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'Enter');
  await page.click('.toggle');
  // custom code starts
  await expect(page).toHaveText('Clear completed');
  // custom code ends
  await page.click('text=Clear completed');
});
```

### Assert that an element appears

Rather than asserting that the text `"Clear completed"` appears on the page, we could instead assert that the `"Clear completed"` button appears on the page.

In terms of the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), this means that there should be an element with the class `"clear-completed"`. The corresponding [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) for an element with the class `"clear-completed"` is `.clear-completed`.

We'll use the [`toHaveSelector` method](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright#toHaveSelector) to assert that the CSS selector `.clear-completed` appears on the page after we complete our todo.

Our test now looks like this:

```js
// ...

test('myTest', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://todomvc.com/examples/react');
  await page.click('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]');
  await page.type('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'create test!');
  await page.press('[placeholder="What needs to be done?"]', 'Enter');
  await page.click('.toggle');
  // custom code starts
  await expect(page).toHaveSelector('.clear-completed');
  // custom code ends
  await page.click('text=Clear completed');
});
```

If the `"Clear completed"` button does not appear on the page, our test will fail.

## Save a test

Now let's return to the command line. You'll notice a few options here:

- `💾 Save and Exit`: saves your test code and closes the browser
- `🖥️ Open REPL to run code`: opens the [QA Wolf interactive REPL](use_the_repl) so you can try out code
- `🗑️ Discard and Exit`: closes the browser without saving your test code

Use the up and down arrow keys to choose between options. The default is `💾 Save and Exit`. Make sure this option is highlighted and press `Enter` to save your test.

## Next steps

Congratulations - you just created your first test with QA Wolf! 🎉

Now let's [run our test locally](run_tests_locally).
