In previous tutorials we [created our first browser test](create_a_test) and [ran it locally](run_a_test_locally) to make sure it works. Now let's dive deeper into the code so we better understand how it works.

## Folder structure

You'll notice that a folder with the name `.qawolf` was created at the root level of your project after you created your first test. This folder holds two more folders: `.qawolf/tests` and `.qawolf/selectors`.

Our test is in the `.qawolf/tests` folder with the name `myFirstTest.test.js` (or whatever else you named your test). Information about which elements you interacted with are stored in the corresponding file named `myFirstTest.json` in the `.qawolf/selectors` folder (more on [selectors](review_test_code#element-selectors) shortly).

The `.qawolf` directory structure is shown below.

```bash
.qawolf # current directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myFirstTest.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectors
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myFirstTest.json
```

When you add additional tests, the test code will be added to the `.qawolf/tests` folder, and the corresponding selectors will be added to the `.qawolf/selectors` folder.

## Overview of test code

Let's look at the generated test code in `.qawolf/tests/myFirstTest.test.js`. The test code includes the `qawolf` library, which is built on top of [Playwright](https://pptr.dev/) to automate browser actions. The tests are written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io), which is a JavaScript testing framework. You have full access to the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api) APIs in your test code.

Below we provide a brief overview of the generated test code with an example test file for [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react). The contents of each test are contained in a [Jest describe block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#describename-fn). The test name is set to what you specified when creating the test, or the URL hostname if you didn't specify a name.

```js
const { launch } = require("qawolf");
const selectors = require("../selectors/myFirstTest");

describe("myFirstTest", () => {
  let browser;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    browser = await launch({ url: "http://todomvc.com/examples/react" });
  });

  afterAll(() => browser.close());

  it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
    await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
  });

  it("can Enter", async () => {
    await browser.type(selectors[1], "‚ÜìEnter‚ÜëEnter");
  });

  it("can click input", async () => {
    await browser.click(selectors[2]);
  });

  it('can click "Clear completed" button', async () => {
    await browser.click(selectors[3]);
  });
});
```

When we run our test, it will first open a [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser with the specified URL. Each step of our workflow will then be completed. In our case, we 1) type our todo item into the input, 2) hit Enter, 3) click to complete the todo, and 4) click the "Clear completed" button. Each of these steps corresponds to a [Jest test case](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testname-fn-timeout). If a step cannot be completed, the test will fail.

After the test is complete, the browser will close.

Now let's dive a bit deeper into the test code.

## QA Wolf browser

The first line of the generated test code imports a [method called `launch`](api#qawolflaunchoptions) from the `qawolf` library:

```js
const { launch } = require("qawolf");
```

`launch` is an [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) that returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to an instance of the [QA Wolf Browser class](api#class-browser). The QA Wolf browser class extends the [Playwright Browser class](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-browser).

The test code calls `launch` in a [Jest `beforeAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#beforeallfn-timeout). This means that a Chromium browser will be opened with the specified URL before the tests run.

```js
let browser;

beforeAll(async () => {
  browser = await launch({ url: "http://todomvc.com/examples/react" });
});
```

An instance of the QA Wolf Browser class includes methods to interact with a web application, such as [`click`](api#browserclickselector-options) and [`type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options). It also includes helper methods for assertions, like [`hasText`](api#browserhastexttext-options) and [`findProperty`](api#browserfindpropertyselector-property-options).

Each step of the test calls a method like [`click`](api#browserclickselector-options) or [`type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options) on the `browser`. The step is contained in a [Jest `it` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testname-fn-timeout), and is automatically named based on the action you took in the browser.

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
});
```

The main benefits that the QA Wolf browser provide include [automatic waiting](review_test_code#automatic-waiting) for each element or assertion before moving on. This means you don't have to write custom wait logic or sleep statements.

The QA Wolf browser also can use "smart" [element selectors](review_test_code#element-selectors) to find the element to interact with in each step based on multiple attributes. The next section explores this in more detail.

After the tests have run, the `browser` is closed in a [Jest `afterAll` block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#afterallfn-timeout):

```js
afterAll(() => browser.close());
```

## Element selectors

You'll notice in the test code above that the [`click`](api#browserclickselector-options) and [`type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options) methods on [`browser`](api#class-browser) take an argument that looks like `selectors[0]`:

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
});
```

The `selectors` are imported from the `.qawolf/selectors/myFirstTest.json` file:

```js
const selectors = require("../selectors/myFirstTest");
```

The `.qawolf/selectors/myFirstTest.json` file is a [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) file containing an [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object). The file looks something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "html": {
      "ancestors": [
        "<header class=\"header\" data-reactid=\".0.0\"></header>",
        "<div data-reactid=\".0\"></div>"
      ],
      "node": "<input class=\"new-todo\" placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\" value=\"\" data-reactid=\".0.0.1\"/>"
    }
  }
  // ...
]
```

The generated [selector](api#interface-selector) includes the following keys:

- `index`: which step number the selector corresponds to, starting at `0`
- `html`: the [node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node) that was interacted with, and its two direct [ancestors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentElement)

The test code references the generated [selector](api#interface-selector) in each step:

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
});
```

The most important thing about the selector is that it includes all the information it can about the target element and its two ancestors. The `qawolf` library can therefore find the target element based on multiple attributes. This helps make tests robust to changes in your application as well as dynamic attributes like CSS classes. If a close enough match for the target element is not found, the test will fail.

You can optionally replace the default selector with a custom CSS or text selector (more on this in the [edit code tutorial](edit_test_code#use-custom-selectors)).

The next section goes into detail on how the generated selector works.

## How the generated selector works

When an element contains an attribute specified by [`QAW_ATTRIBUTE`](api#qaw_attribute) (`data-qa,data-test,data-testid` by default), a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) for that attribute will be generated. See [üîç Use a Test Attribute](use_a_test_attribute) for more details.

Otherwise QA Wolf serializes the entire element, its [parent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentElement), and parent's parent, to make your tests robust to changes instead of relying on a specific attribute like an xpath to locate elements. The serialized elements are then stored in the selector (`.qawolf/selectors/myFirstTest.json`). QA Wolf uses the [open source `html-parse-stringify` library](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify) to serialize each element.

When you run a test, QA Wolf goes through the following steps to locate each element ([source code](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/blob/master/packages/web/src/find/findHtml.ts)):

1. A list of candidate elements is generated based on the type of action (like `click` or `type`) to take. For example, if the next action is a `type` action, only elements that can accept keyboard input like inputs are considered.
2. Candidate elements are ranked by how closely they match the target element and its two direct ancestors. Certain attributes like text content, `id`, `title`, and `name` are considered indicative of a strong match. Elements that share these "strong match" attributes with the target are ranked highest. All candidates are then ordered by how closely their attributes match those of the target element.
3. If there is a strong match with the target, the test acts on that element. Otherwise, if the similarity between the highest ranked candidate and the target is above a threshold, the test acts on the highest ranked candidate. If no good enough match is found, QA Wolf will keep trying to find a match. The threshold similarity is reduced slowly over time to 75%. In other words, QA Wolf first tries to find a perfect match, but over time it allows a larger amount of divergence between the candidate and target elements.
4. If a matching element is not found within a [specified timeout](api#qaw_find_timeout_ms) (default 30 seconds), the test fails.

If you [replace the generated selector](edit_test_code#use-custom-selectors) with a custom selector, QA Wolf will wait until it finds an element matching that selector. If no match is found before the [timeout](api#qaw_find_timeout_ms), the test fails.

## Automatic waiting

QA Wolf is built to avoid [flaky tests](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/flaky-test), so automatic waiting comes out of the box. Automatic waiting allows us to avoid writing custom wait logic or arbitrary sleep statements.

The action methods like [`click`](api#browserclickselector-options) and [`type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options) on the [`browser`](api#class-browser) automatically wait for the target element to appear before moving on. For example, after we click to complete our todo, it takes a bit of time for the "Clear completed" button to appear on the page. In this case, the `qawolf` library will keep looking for the "Clear completed" button until it appears, at which point it will be clicked.

The [`browser`](api#class-browser) also automatically waits for network requests to finish or time out. If you [include an assertion](edit_test_code#add-an-assertion) based on one of the [`browser` class helper methods](api#class-browser), QA Wolf will automatically wait to get the data you asked for before moving on.

One caveat is that elements may appear on the page before event handlers are attached. By default we [sleep for 1 second](api#qaw_sleep_ms) after an element is found to mitigate this issue. However, you can [edit your test code](edit_test_code) to include custom wait logic instead for these scenarios. [The `waitUntil` helper](api#qawolfwaituntilpredicate-timeoutms-sleepms) will likely be useful here.

## Keyboard events

QA Wolf captures `keydown` and `keyup` events so it can perfectly match the original keystrokes. This allows us to support special keys like `Tab` and `Enter` and hotkeys.

If no special characters are found, the keystrokes are simplified to a plain string for human-readability.

Example:

```js
// original key events
await type(selectors[0], "‚ÜìKeyL‚ÜëKeyL‚ÜìKeyA‚ÜìKeyU‚ÜëKeyA‚ÜìKeyR‚ÜëKeyU‚ÜëKeyR‚ÜìKeyA‚ÜëKeyA");

// simplified
await type(selectors[0], "laura");
```

When a special key like `Enter` is pressed, all keyboard events are included in the generated test code:

```js
await browser.type(selectors[1], "‚ÜìEnter‚ÜëEnter");
```
