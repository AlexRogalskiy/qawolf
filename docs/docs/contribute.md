## Development Environment

QAWolf is organized as a mono-repo of packages using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

Run bootstrap to install, build and link the dependencies. You should re-run this everytime you change a package's dependencies.

```sh
npm run bootstrap
```

Run the the watchers to keep the `/lib` folders up to date.

```sh
cd ./qawolf
npm run watch

cd ./qawolf/packages/web
npm run watch
```

## What are all of these packages?!

[@qawolf/web](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/web) is a JS library that runs inside the browser. It has helpers to auto-wait for elements and assertions, and a Recorder to collect user interaction events.

[@qawolf/browser](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/browser) is a wrapper around Puppeteer that injects the `@qawolf/web` library and exposes helpers to use it. It switches to the page of a selector, waits for requests to finish, and manages keyboard interactions.

[@qawolf/build-workflow](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/build-workflow) converts user interaction events into a workflow of steps to take.

[@qawolf/build-code](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/build-code) builds a test or script from a workflow.

[@qawolf/screen](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/screen) creates the video and gif artifacts with ffmpeg.

[@qawolf/cli](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/tree/master/packages/cli) ties everything together into commands.

[qawolf/qawolf docker](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf/blob/master/Dockerfile) sets up Puppeteer and ffmpeg as dependencies to run the code and collect artifacts (video, GIF, etc).
