title: üî• Smoke Tests with Alerts
---

This may sound familiar: someone pushed code to production and now a critical user workflow is broken. How could you have caught the bug before a user did? üò±

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll learn about smoke testing as a line of defense against bugs on production. We‚Äôll set up smoke tests on a website, and build an alerting system that tells us when something isn‚Äôt working. Let‚Äôs get started!

## What are smoke tests?

Smoke tests are tests that cover the most important functionality of an application. For example, on Netflix the critical user workflows include signing in and watching a movie. The term ‚Äúsmoke test‚Äù originated in hardware repair, where a machine would fail the smoke test if it caught on fire when turned on. üî•

[According to Microsoft](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms182613(v=vs.80)?redirectedfrom=MSDN>), ‚Äúsmoke testing is the most cost-effective method for identifying and fixing defects in software‚Äù after code reviews. This is because smoke tests are **not** intended to cover every permutation and edge case. Instead, smoke tests verify that the critical functionality isn't broken to the point where further testing would be unnecessary.

The book [<i>Lessons Learned in Software Testing</i>](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/lessons-learned-in/9780471081128/) summarizes it well: "smoke tests broadly cover product features in a limited time...if key features don't work or if key bugs haven't yet been fixed, your team won't waste further time installing or testing."

## 1. Set up project

Let‚Äôs set up our project for our first smoke test! First, make sure that you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To get started, either create a new [Node.js](ttps://nodejs.org) project, or change directories into an existing one.

To create a new project, run the following in the command line:

```bash
mkdir smoke-tests
cd smoke-tests
npm init -y
```

You can follow along in this example GitHub repository. [Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/ee0d7d51265215ae9abe9a1579c7da99a414f78b)

Next we need to install the `qawolf` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qawolf). QA Wolf is a free and open source Node.js library that generates [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test code from your browser actions. It also allows you to quickly set up running your tests on a schedule in various CI providers.

In the command line, run the following to install `qawolf` as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm i -D qawolf
```

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/8d08948a3080e1c2abcf0489a40a653b39d5e98e)

## 2. Create a smoke test

Now let's create our first smoke test. In this tutorial, we'll smoke test [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react), a simple todo application. Specifically, we'll create a todo item, complete it, and clear completed todos.

When we run the `npx qawolf record` command, a [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser will open and capture our actions such as clicks and typing into inputs. These actions will then be converted to [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test code (more on this in the [review code section](smoke_tests_with_alerts#4-review-smoke-test-code)).

To record your test, run the following in the command line. You can optionally replace `http://todomvc.com/examples/react` with a different URL, and `myFirstSmokeTest` with a different name.

```bash
npx qawolf record http://todomvc.com/examples/react myFirstSmokeTest
```

Inside the Chromium browser, go through the workflow you want to test as a user would. In our example, we'll 1) create a todo item, 2) mark it as complete, and 3) clear completed todos. After you are done, return to the terminal and hit Enter to save your test. See the GIF below for an example.

![Record a test](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/create_test.gif)

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/caa0fccc1ee3472b2108fd03148cac6c6848134c) We'll dive deeper into the test code shortly, but first let's run our test locally.

## 3. Run smoke test locally

Let's run our test to confirm it works locally. In the command line, run the following command. If applicable, replace `myFirstSmokeTest` with your test name.

```bash
npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest
```

A Chromium browser will open and the test will run. See the GIF below for an example.

![Run a test locally](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/run_test.gif)

Once your test is running locally, move on to the next step.

## 4. Review smoke test code

Next we'll review our test code and optionally edit it.

You'll notice that a folder with the name `.qawolf` was created at the root level of your project. This folder holds two more folders: `.qawolf/tests` and `.qawolf/selectors`. Our test is in the `.qawolf/tests` folder with the name `myFirstSmokeTest.test.js` (or whatever else you named your test). The `.qawolf` directory structure is shown below.

```bash
.qawolf # current directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myFirstSmokeTest.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectors
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myFirstSmokeTest.json
```

Let's look at the generated test code in `.qawolf/tests/myFirstSmokeTest.test.js`. The test code includes the `qawolf` library, which is built on top of [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to automate browser actions.

When we run our test, it will first open a Chromium browser with the specified URL. Each step of our workflow will then be executed. In our case, we 1) type our todo item into the input, 2) hit Enter, 3) click to complete the todo, and 4) click the "Clear completed" button. Each of these steps corresponds to a [Jest test case](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testname-fn-timeout). After the test is complete, the browser will close.

```js
const { launch } = require("qawolf");
const selectors = require("../selectors/myFirstSmokeTest");

describe("myFirstSmokeTest", () => {
  let browser;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    browser = await launch({ url: "http://todomvc.com/examples/react" });
  });

  afterAll(() => browser.close());

  it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
    await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
  });

  it("can Enter", async () => {
    await browser.type(selectors[1], "‚ÜìEnter‚ÜëEnter");
  });

  it("can click input", async () => {
    await browser.click(selectors[2]);
  });

  it('can click "Clear completed" button', async () => {
    await browser.click(selectors[3]);
  });
});
```

A few other things about the test code are worth mentioning before we move on.

### Element Selectors

First, the `click` and `type` methods on `browser` take an object of [type `Selector`](api#interface-selector). These selectors are stored in the `.qawolf/selectors/myFirstSmokeTest.json` file. The test code then imports them:

```js
const selectors = require("../selectors/myFirstSmokeTest");
```

Each selector is an object that includes the following keys:

- `index`: which step number the selector corresponds to, starting at `0`
- `page`: which page number the element is on (relevant when the workflow uses mulitple pages or tabs)
- `html`: the [node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node) that was interacted with, and its two direct [ancestors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentElement)

Below is an example of a selector:

```json
{
  "index": 0,
  "page": 0,
  "html": {
    "ancestors": [
      "<header class=\"header\" data-reactid=\".0.0\"></header>",
      "<div data-reactid=\".0\"></div>"
    ],
    "node": "<input class=\"new-todo\" placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\" value=\"\" data-reactid=\".0.0.1\"/>"
  }
}
```

You don't need to worry too much about the selector. The most important point is that it includes all the information it can about the target element and its two ancestors. The `qawolf` library can therefore find the target element based on multiple attributes. This helps make tests robust to changes in your application as well as dynamic attributes like CSS classes. If a close enough match for the target element is not found, the test will fail.

You can optionally replace the default selector with a custom CSS or text selector (more on this in the [edit code section](smoke_tests_with_alerts#use-custom-selectors)). See documentation on [how element selectors work](how_it_works#-element-selectors) and on [the `Selector` interface](api#interface-selector) to learn more.

### Automatic Waiting

QA Wolf is built to avoid [flaky tests](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/flaky-test), so automatic waiting comes out of the box. This means that the `click` and `type` methods on the `browser` automatically wait for the target element to appear before moving on. For example, after we click to complete our todo, it takes a bit of time for the "Clear completed" button to appear on the page. In this case, the `qawolf` library will keep looking for the "Clear completed" button until it appears, at which point it will be clicked.

Automatic waiting allows us to avoid writing custom wait logic or arbitrary sleep statements. See documentation on the [QA Wolf Browser class](api#class-browser) and on [automatic waiting](how_it_works#Ô∏è-automatic-waiting) to learn more.

At this point, feel free to create additional smoke tests before moving on.

## 5. Optional: Edit smoke test code

You can use the test code as is to verify that your workflow isn't broken. If a step of your workflow cannot be completed because no match is found for the target element, the test will fail.

However, you can still edit the test code to suit your use case. This section provides examples for [adding an assertion](smoke_tests_with_alerts#add-an-assertion), [using a custom CSS or text selector](smoke_tests_with_alerts#use-custom-selectors) to locate an element, or [changing an input value](smoke_tests_with_alerts#change-input-values). Each section is self-contained, so feel free to skip to the section(s) of interest.

### Add an assertion

Let's beef up our test by adding a few assertions. First, we'll add an assertion that the "Clear completed" text appears after we complete our todo.

To do this, we'll use the [`browser.hasText` method](docs/api#browserhastexttext-options). This method automatically waits for the given text to appear on the page. It returns `true` if the text is found, and `false` if the text does not appear before timing out.

In our test code, let's update the following step where we click to complete the todo. We'll call `browser.hasText("Clear completed")`, assign the result to a variable called `hasClearCompletedText`, and assert that `hasClearCompletedText` is `true`. See [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect) to learn more about assertions.

```js
it("can click input", async () => {
  await browser.click(selectors[2]);

  // custom code starts
  // verify that "Clear completed" text appears
  const hasClearCompletedText = await browser.hasText("Clear completed");
  expect(hasClearCompletedText).toBe(true);
  // custom code ends
});
```

If you run the test again (`npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest`), you'll see that it still passes.

After we clear completed todos, we should no longer see any todos on the page. We'll add code that waits until the todos `<section>` no longer exists on the page to verify that it disappears. To do so, we'll use the [`waitUntil` helper method](api#qawolfwaituntilpredicate-timeoutms-sleepms), which takes a function and a timeout in milliseconds. It waits until the function returns `true`, throwing an error if the timeout is reached. We'll also use the [Puppeteer API](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md).

Now let's update the test code. Here is a summary of what we'll do:

1. Use the [`browser.page` method](api#browserpageoptions) to get the current [Puppeteer `page` instance](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#class-page).
2. Call [`waitUntil`](api#qawolfwaituntilpredicate-timeoutms-sleepms), passing it a function that calls [Puppeteer's `page.$` method](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pageselector) to find the todos `<section>`. The `page.$` method runs [`document.querySelector`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) with the given [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) and returns the matching [Puppeteer `ElementHandle`](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-elementhandle) or null if none found.
3. Pass the [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) `section.main` to [Puppeteer's `page.$` method](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pageselector). In [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react), `section.main` contains the todos and will disappear from the page once todos have been cleared.

Once the todos `<section>` no longer exists because the todos have been cleared, we will end the test. If a bug on the application prevents the todos from being cleared, the test will fail.

First, update the first line of your test file to also import `waitUntil` from `qawolf`:

```js
// change this
const { launch } = require("qawolf");
// to this
const { launch, waitUntil } = require("qawolf");
```

Then update the final step of the test:

```js
it('can click "Clear completed" button', async () => {
  await browser.click(selectors[3]);

  // custom code starts
  // get current Puppeteer page instance
  const page = await browser.page();

  // verify that todos disappear after clearing completed
  await waitUntil(async () => {
    // find the todos section on the page
    const todosSection = await page.$("section.main");
    // return true once the secton is null (no longer exists)
    return todosSection === null;
  }, 15000); // wait 15 seconds before timing out
  // custom code ends
});
```

If you run the test again (`npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest`), you'll see that it still passes.

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/3ee8e15bf4c10d87549e2a5b2d6549e8c598d95d)

See [QA Wolf API documentation](api) for a full list of methods you can use to write assertions.

### Use custom selectors

As [discussed earlier](smoke_tests_with_alerts#element-selectors), the default selector in the generated test code contains all attributes of an element and its two direct [ancestors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentElement). When running a test, the `qawolf` library will wait for a close enough match to the default selector before moving on. If no suitable match is found before timing out, the test will fail.

You may want to edit the test code to use selectors of your choosing rather than the default selectors. This allows you to be explicit about which element to target in each step of your test.

The two supported custom selectors are [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) and text selectors:

- [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) find the element matching the CSS selector, for example: `#my-id`, `.my-class`, `div.my-class`, `[data-qa="my-input"]`
- Text selectors find the element that contains the given text

In your test code, replace the default selector (for example, `selectors[0]`) with an object containing either the `css` or `text` key and the desired target value. For example:

```js
it('can click "Clear completed" button', async () => {
  // change this
  await browser.click(selectors[3]);
  // to this (CSS selector)
  await browser.click({ css: ".clear-completed" });
  // or this (text selector)
  await browser.click({ text: "Clear completed" });
});
```

[Learn more about custom selectors here.](api#interface-selector)

Try changing the default selector to either of the above examples. Then run your test again (`npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest`) and notice that it still passes.

Whenever you target an element with a CSS or text selector, make sure that your selector is as specific as possible. If your selector matches multiple elements on the page, you could end up with the wrong element being acted upon in your test.

A best practice in testing is to add [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) like `data-qa` to target elements. This involves editing your front end code, but it allows you to be most explicit about which elements to target when running tests. For example:

```html
<!-- change this -->
<button class="clear-completed">Clear completed</button>
<!-- to this -->
<button data-qa="clear-button" class="clear-completed">Clear completed</button>
```

If you have added a data attribute to an element in your test, you can update the test code to use a CSS selector targeting that data attribute and value.

```js
it('can click "Clear completed" button', async () => {
  // change this
  await browser.click(selectors[3]);
  // to this
  await browser.click({ css: "[data-qa='clear-button']" });
});
```

You can also record your test while setting the [`QAW_DATA_ATTRIBUTE` environment variable](api#qaw_data_attribute). This will use your data attribute to find elements where applicable rather than the default selector logic. For example:

```bash
QAW_DATA_ATTRIBUTE=data-qa npx qawolf record www.myawesomesite.com myTest
```

See [QA Wolf documentation](api#qaw_data_attribute) to learn more about the `QAW_DATA_ATTRIBUTE` environment variable.

### Change input values

You'll notice that the initial step for typing the todo captured the value we typed as the second argument to [`browser.type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options). In our example, we typed `"create smoke test!"` as our todo item. The following code was then generated:

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
});
```

However, you may want to change this input value to something else. The simplest way to do this is to change that second argument to [`browser.type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options) in the test code:

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  // change this
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
  // to this
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "update smoke test!");
});
```

If you run the test again (`npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest`) you'll see that it now types `"update smoke test!"` in the first step.

You can also pass an environment variable to [`browser.type`](api#browsertypeselector-value-options). To do this, update the test code to use `process.env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE`:

```js
it('can type into "What needs to be done?" input', async () => {
  // change this
  await browser.type(selectors[0], "create smoke test!");
  // to this
  await browser.type(selectors[0], process.env.TODO_VALUE);
});
```

You can then run your test again, passing the appropriate environment variable. It will now type the value of your environment variable in the first step.

```bash
TODO_VALUE="create environment variable!" npx qawolf test myFirstSmokeTest
```

One final note: **you should always replace sensitive input values like passwords with environment variables.** Use the above example as a reference.

## 6. Run smoke tests on a schedule

Now that we have our smoke test running locally, let's run it in CI on a schedule. In this tutorial, we'll use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub Actions is free for open source repositories, and free for private repositories up to 2,000 minutes per month (or more if you have a paid plan).

You can also use a different CI provider, as the setup will be very similar to this example.

### Run tests in CI

To get started, we need to create a workflow file for GitHub Actions. In your terminal run:

```bash
npx qawolf github
```

Note: the commands `npx qawolf azure`, `npx qawolf circleci`, and `npx qawolf gitlab` are also supported. Use these commands instead for [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), and [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html) respectively.

You'll notice that a file called `.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` was created in your project. In a nutshell, this file tells GitHub to run your tests whenever a commit is pushed. It also automatically uploads debugging artifacts like video recordings of tests and detailed logs.

We will soon edit this file to also run our smoke tests on a schedule. See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow) to learn more about configuring workflows.

If you haven't already, [create a repository for your project on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) or another provider. Then [push your code](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) to your repository.

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/f27babd546ee8599d1191aedd05473fc1d405967)

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you should see that your smoke test is now running. This is because our workflow file runs our tests every time a commit is pushed. Click the "Actions" tab on the main page of your repository (next to the "Pull Requests" tab) to view all workflows.

![GitHub Actions tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/github_actions.png)

After your workflow has passed, click on the workflow name ("qawolf" by default) to see more detail.

![Select qawolf workflow](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/all_workflows.png)

In the top right corner of the workflow page, you'll notice a button labeled "Artifacts". Click on this button to reveal a dropdown that allows you to download artifacts. Go ahead and download the artifacts!

![Download artifacts](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/download_artifacts.png)

The artifacts folder is structured like the following example. Of particular interest are the video (`qawolf/myFirstSmokeTest.test.js/video_1577653225931.mp4` in our example), GIF (`qawolf/myFirstSmokeTest.test.js/video_1577653225931.gif` in our example), and logs (`qawolf/myFirstSmokeTest.test.js/1577653224576.log` in our example).

```bash
qawolf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp].log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myFirstSmokeTest.test.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp].log
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video_[timestamp].mp4
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video_[timestamp].gif
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page_[index]_[timestamp].html
```

Watching the video and reading the logs are very helpful in debugging when something isn't working. Below is the GIF artifact of running our smoke test on [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react) as an example.

![GIF artifact](https://storage.googleapis.com/docs.qawolf.com/tutorials/video_1577653225931.gif)

See [QA Wolf documentation](set_up_ci#Ô∏è-debug) to learn more about debugging artifacts.

### Run tests on schedule

To run our tests on a schedule in addition to on push, we need to make one small change to our workflow file. Open the `.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file in your project. Comment in the three lines that run tests on a schedule (lines 7-9 in the default generated file). The top of your file should now look like this, and [your code base should now look like this](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/35bb5087c1ab6a1c48cf0d337066cfe832669e5b):

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  # !!! comment in the following 3 lines
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
  # ...
```

Note: you can also run tests on a schedule with other CI providers. See [documentation on setting up CI](set_up_ci) to learn more.

You can control how often tests are run using [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/). By default the value `"0 * * * *"` is specified by the `cron` key, which will run your tests every hour on the hour.

If you want to run your tests more or less frequently, change the value specified by the `cron` key in your workflow file. For example, we'll update our workflow file to run tests once a day at midnight UTC.

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  # !!! comment in the following 3 lines
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    # change this
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
    # to this
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # once a day
  # ...
```

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/4a6e345b950430beb8ed0ab82727774321248f30) Make sure to push your latest workflow file to your remote repository.

### Optional: Upload artifacts only on failure

Depending on how often you're running your tests and on your CI provider, you may hit artifact storage limits. For example, GitHub Actions will prevent you from uploading additional artifacts once the storage limit is reached.

One way to mitigate this is to only upload artifacts when your tests fail, since you probably won't view them when tests pass.

To upload artifacts only when your tests fail, you just need to change one line of code. In the `.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file, change the line `if: always()` to `if: failure()`. For example:

```yaml
# ...
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Upload Artifacts
        # include test artifacts
        # edit below to only include artifacts in certain scenarios
        # change this
        if: always()
        # to this
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: qawolf
          path: "./artifacts"

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/b17e807b95967f1145f6a37eb2b1f0b80b831460)

Now our artifacts will only be uploaded when tests fail. See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif) to learn more.

## 7. Set up alerts on failure

We are now running smoke tests against an application on a schedule. These tests will verify that the critical functionality is working on an ongoing basis. To finish this tutorial, we will set up an alerting system so that we are notified when our smoke tests fail.

In this tutorial, we'll post messages to [Slack](https://slack.com/) when tests fail. Slack has a free plan, so it's easy to get started. You can also use services like [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), and the setup will be very similar to the examples below.

If you'd like to follow along and you don't already have a Slack workspace, [get started here](https://slack.com/get-started#/email).

### Create Slack webhook

We first need to create an incoming webhook, which is a unique URL that we can use to programmatically post messages to Slack. In our case, we'll make a POST request to this URL when our tests fail, so that we are notified of the failure in Slack. We'll be following [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) here, so use this as a reference if needed.

The first step is to create a Slack app. Our app will be able to receive incoming webhooks, which we will use to post a message when tests fail. If you don't have a Slack app for your workspace yet, [create one here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1). In our example, we named our app "Smoke Tests", and made sure to select the correct workspace from the dropdown.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

After you create your Slack app, you'll be redirected to its settings page. On this page, click on the "Incoming Webhooks" feature.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

Make sure the "Activate Incoming Webhooks" toggle is switched to on to enable incoming webhooks.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

You'll notice then when you switch the "Activate Incoming Webhooks" toggle to on, some extra options will appear. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Add New Webhook to Workspace" button.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

A new page will appear where you can choose a channel that your messages will post to. In our example we chose the `#general` channel, but choose whatever channel you like. Then click the "Allow" button.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

You'll then be redirected back to your app settings. You'll notice a new entry under "Webhook URLs for Your Workspace" on the "Incoming Webhooks" page. The URL will have a format like:

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

Now we have a URL that we can use to programmatically post messages to Slack when our tests fail. If you'd like to try it out now, run the following command in your terminal. Make sure to replace the sample URL with your webhook URL.

```bash
curl -d '{"text":"Hello, World!"}' -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

You should see a message post to the channel you specified when setting up your webhook!

### Post to webhook on failure

The final step is configuring our workflow to post a message to Slack when tests fail. Thankfully, we can accomplish this in just a few lines of code.

Let's revisit our `.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file. After our step to Upload Artifacts, we will add another step to post a message to Slack only on failure.

The lines we will add look like the following. Make sure to replace the sample webhook URL with your actual webhook URL.

```yaml
- name: Post Message to Slack
  # if smoke tests fails trigger alert in Slack
  if: failure()
  run: curl -d '{"text":"Smoke tests failed!"}' -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  shell: bash
```

Let's dissect this code a bit:

- `name`: the name of our step, in this case "Post Message to Slack" ([documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsname))
- `if`: defines the condition that must be met for the step to run, in our case test failure ([documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif))
- `run`: allows us to provide a command to run using the operating system's shell ([documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun))
- `shell`: which shell to use to run the command, defaults to `bash` on non-Windows platforms ([documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell))

We should add these lines after the `Upload Artifacts` step, as shown below. Again make sure to replace the sample webhook URL with your actual webhook URL.

```yaml
# ...
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Upload Artifacts
        # include test artifacts
        # edit below to only include artifacts in certain scenarios
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: qawolf
          path: "./artifacts"
      # new code starts
      - name: Post Message to Slack
        # if smoke tests fails trigger alert in Slack
        if: failure()
        run: curl -d '{"text":"Smoke tests failed!"}' -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        shell: bash
      # new code ends
```

One final consideration: **you probably don't want your webhook URL to be visible in your code, especially if you have a public repository.** Let's replace it with a [GitHub secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) so that we don't need to worry about someone gaining access to our webhook URL and spamming our Slack channel.

[Add a GitHub secret to your repository following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) In our example, we'll call our secret `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. For the value of your secret, use your Slack webhook URL.

TODO: INSERT IMAGE

We now need to replace the Slack webhook URL with `${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}` in our workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Post Message to Slack
  # if smoke tests fails trigger alert in Slack
  if: failure()
  # change this
  run: curl -d '{"text":"Smoke tests failed!"}' -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  # to this
  run: curl -d '{"text":"Smoke tests failed!"}' -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
  shell: bash
```

[Your code base should now look like this.](https://github.com/qawolf/tutorials-smoke-tests/tree/1a8d8ee047c3e9862ebcf3489963f61c500ecb3b)

If you want to test that your alerting system works, change `if: failure()` to `if: always()` and push to your remote repository. This will configure your tests to always post a message to Slack. Once you're satisfied that it works, change it back to `if: failure()`.

```yaml
- name: Post Message to Slack
  # if smoke tests fails trigger alert in Slack
  # change this
  if: failure()
  # to this
  if: always()
  run: curl -d '{"text":"Smoke tests failed!"}' -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
  shell: bash
```

## Conclusion

If you've made it this far, congratulations! üéâ
