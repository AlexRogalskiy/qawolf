<Syntax code="repl([context={}])" />

Pause a running test and open the [interactive REPL](../../use_the_repl).

Use the [`--repl` flag](../cli#npx-qawolf-test-name) when running tests that call `repl`:

```bash
npx qawolf test --repl myTestName
```

### Arguments

<ArgumentRepl />

### Returns

<ReturnVoid />

### Examples

Import `repl` from `qawolf` in your test code:

```js
const { launch, repl } = require("qawolf");
const selectors = require("../selectors/myTestName");
```

Call `repl` in your test code, passing whatever values you want to access in the REPL. Note that `browser` is included by default, so you do not need to include it again:

```js
it("can click button", async () => {
  await repl({ selectors }); // already includes browser

  await browser.click(selectors[2]);
});
```

Run your test with the `--repl` flag:

```bash
npx qawolf test --repl myTestName
```

Your test will run until `repl` is called, at which point the test will pause and the [interactive REPL](../../use_the_repl) will open. After you exit the REPL by calling `.exit`, the test will continue. You can call `repl` any number of times in your test.
