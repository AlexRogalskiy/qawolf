The QA Wolf `BrowserContext` class extends [Playwright `BrowserContext`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/v0.10.0/docs/api.md#class-browsercontext) class.

### Examples

See [API table of contents](../table_of_contents#class-browsercontext) for a list of methods that QA Wolf provides on the `BrowserContext` class.

Any method that can be called on a Playwright `BrowserContext` instance can also be called on a QA Wolf `BrowserContext` instance. For example, use Playwright's [`browserContext.setCookies` method](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/v0.10.0/docs/api.md#browsercontextsetcookiescookies) to set cookies:

```js
let browser;

beforeAll(async () => {
  browser = await launch({
    url: "www.myawesomesite.com"
  });

  await browser.setCookies([{
    name: "my-cookie",
    value: "my-cookie",
    expires: 4102444800000, // 2100-01-01
    url: "www.myawesomesite.com"
  ]});
});
```
