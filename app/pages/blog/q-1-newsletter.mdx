Happy April 1st from the QA Wolf Team! üê∫

It's not lost on us that our first newsletter is coming out on April Fool's Day ü•∏.

But rest assured, none of the updates below are jokes! We've been hard at work making QA Wolf the best browser testing tool available.

Since we're catching up on the last several months, we have a lot to share, so buckle up and put on your blue light blocking glasses! Going forward, we'll stick to monthly updates.

Let's get into it:

### April (In progress)

- **Netlify integration.** Run tests on Netlify deploys with the QA Wolf build plugin (<ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/run-tests-on-netlify-deployment">Completed!</ExternalLink>)

- **Decrease flakes.** This is an ongoing priority for us. We're aiming to decrease flakiness in your tests while also maintaining speed.

- **Run tests with CLI.** Use the QA Wolf CLI to create tests and wait for results with one command (<ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/run-tests-with-cli">Completed!</ExternalLink>)

Want to influence our roadmap? [Email](mailto:hello@qawolf.com`) us with your suggestion!

### March (Completed)

- **Added Snippets - #1 requested feature.** Now you can add a snippet to choose a selector or assertion (Demo <ExternalLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_MQ14vqe4">here</ExternalLink>).

/>

- **Failure alerts only.** You can enable this feature if you only want to receive alerts when a test has failed (this option is found in your Settings and you can learn more <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/manage-alerts">here</ExternalLink>).

- **Better selectors.** Rewrote the code generation engine to work faster and choose better selectors by default.

- **Run tests with Chrome.** You can now use "chrome" instead of "chromium". This is useful if you are testing video playback since chrome has more video codecs than chromium (learn more <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/launch">here</ExternalLink>).

- **Faker added.** Added <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api">faker</ExternalLink> as a global so you can generate test data.

- **Updated our Docs.** Added an <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/globals">API Section</ExternalLink>, a <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/why-qa-wolf">Why QA Wolf</ExternalLink>, and <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/your-testing-strategy">Testing Strategy</ExternalLink> as well as a search function.

### February (Completed)

- **Test receiving an email.** Do you send email login codes or password reset emails? Now you can test receiving an email with QA Wolf! (Demo <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/manage-alerts">here</ExternalLink>).

- **Dashboard redesign.** We refreshed the testing dashboard and added an onboarding sequence. If you haven't logged in for a bit, check it out and let us know what you think!

- **Test groups.** You can now organize tests into groups and search them by name or by trigger.

- **Environment variables.** When you click "Edit Test" from a run it includes the environment variables for that run. For vercel or netlify deployments that means the same `process.env.URL` for that run is included.

- **Stop tests mid-run.** Running a test and accidentally select the wrong selector? Don't wait for the test to fail; stop it instantly with the click of a button! (Demo <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/QAWolfHQ/status/1359640199945330695">here</ExternalLink>)

- **View test run history.** When you're inside a test, you can now view the history of that test.

- **Code editor resizing.** Adjust the size of your code editor to view more browser or more code.

/>

- **Analytics-friendly testing.** We now block tracking (google analytics & tag manager) by default to prevent tests from messing up your analytics. You can <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/launch#arguments">disable this</ExternalLink> by passing `allowTracking: true` to launch.

### January (Completed)

- <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/blog/q-1-newsletter/why-we-open-sourced-everything">
    Launched and open-sourced
  </ExternalLink> QA Wolf 2.0 üéâ

- Added ability to <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/reuse-helper-code">share helpers</ExternalLink> across tests.

- Added ability to <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/use-localhost">create tests on localhost</ExternalLink>.

Phew. That was a lot to get off our chests - thanks for giving us a few minutes of your time.
