April was full of product updates and we're excited to share them all with you!

Since it's Wednesday and it's been a busy week for everyone, let's get right to it.

### Ability to run tests with a CLI

#### (most requested feature)

You can now trigger your QA Wolf tests with our CLI. For example: `npx qawolf test`. See our <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/run-tests-with-cli">CLI Docs</ExternalLink> to learn more.

### Netlify Integration

You can now run QA Wolf tests on your <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/docs/run-tests-on-netlify-deployment">Netlify deployments</ExternalLink> with a few clicks. Get started here!

### Comment on GitHub pull requests with test results for Netlify users

QA Wolf now reports test results in a comment on PRs deployed by Netlify.

### GitHub integration (beta)

We are beta testing a GitHub integration that supports multiple test branches and syncs code to your GitHub repo. **Reach out if you would like to be an early user!**

### Persist scroll position across tabs in editor

Now when you switch between the code and helpers tabs, you won't lose your place.

### CSV upload in tests

You can now upload CSV files as part of your automated testing. This is great for websites with user submission forms.

### Self-serve payments

We've updated our pricing! All users now get 100 free test runs per month on our basic plan. If you want to run more than 100 tests, you can now <ExternalLink href="https://www.qawolf.com/pricing">sign up</ExternalLink> for a Business Plan account.

### Continued platform improvements

We're always making improvements to flakiness, general bug fixes, and code generation and April was no exception :)

That wraps up the major product updates for this month. Thanks again for being a part of the QA Wolf community!
