<Header>Run on Schedule</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll schedule our tests to run every day. This helps us ensure our critical workflows are not broken.

<SubHeader>Create Schedule Trigger</SubHeader>

First, we'll create a trigger that runs our tests every day. QA Wolf uses triggers to know how and when to run your tests.

Open a test you want to run every day. Click the "Add trigger" button in the top right corner top open the triggers menu.

<Image

  width={1600}
/>

A popup will open with options to create a trigger. Make sure you are viewing the "Schedule" tab.

Choose whether you want your tests to run every day or every hour. You will also need to choose an <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment</Link> for the trigger.

You can rename your trigger, or keep the default name ("Daily" in our example). Once you are done, click the "Create trigger" button to save your trigger.

<SubHeader>Assign Schedule Trigger to Test</SubHeader>

After your trigger is created, the popup will show a list of triggers and whether they are assigned to your test.

Clicking on the trigger will toggle whether it is assigned to your test. You can also edit or delete a trigger from this popup.

<SubHeader>View Run History</SubHeader>

Now your tests will run every day in parallel.

You can see view previous runs in the "History" panel on the right of the test list in the <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/tests" target="_blank">dashboard</a>.

Now that we scheduled our tests to run, let's <Link href="send-slack-alerts">alert our team</Link> when they fail.
