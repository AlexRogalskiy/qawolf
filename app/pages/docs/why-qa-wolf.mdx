<Header>Why QA Wolf?</Header>

Hi there! üëã Thanks for checking out QA Wolf, an <a href="https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf" target="_blank">open source tool</a> for browser testing. QA Wolf helpes you create, run, and maintain tests faster.

<SubHeader>Who is QA Wolf for?</SubHeader>

QA Wolf is for busy teams who want the fastest way to set up tests. We built it for developers like us who want to spend less time testing and more time shipping.

Our goal is to get you up and running with tests as quickly as possible. In order to do this, QA Wolf needs to be opionated. We optimize for speed and ease of use over configuration. QA Wolf works particularly well with the modern Jamstack.

| Wait for dependencies to install and run up to a few tests in parallel in CI.         | Run 100% of tests in parallel with no additional setup.                                                                                                                                 |
| Fix tests by checking out code, running it locally, and waiting for another CI build. | Debug, fix, and re-run tests directly from the browser.                                                                                                                                 |
