<Header>Globals</Header>

QA Wolf provides globals to your test so you can quickly create tests. <MessageUs/> us if you would like other helpers.

```js
// Generate a random name
const name = faker.name.findName();
console.log(name);
```

The globals available in your test are:

- [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#assert_assert_value_message): Assert a value is truthy. See the [Add an Assertion guide](./add-an-assertion).
- [assertText](./assert-text): Assert text shows up. See the [Add an Assertion guide](./add-an-assertion).
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#axios-api): Make an API request. See the [Call an API guide](./call-an-api).
- <Playwright devices />: Devices to emulate. See the <a href="launch">
    launch doc
  </a>.
- [faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/#api): Generate random test data.
- [getInbox](./getInbox): Receive an email in your test. See the [Receive an Email guide](./receive-an-email).
- [launch](./launch): Launch a browser.
