<Header>Run on Netlify Deployment</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll set up our tests to run on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> deployments. This helps ensure our critical workflows don't break when we make changes.

Specifically, we'll run our tests whenever a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/" target="_blank">Netlify Deploy Preview</a> succeeds in a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> pull request. If you have a different workflow, please <Link href="community">reach out for help</Link>.

<SubHeader>Install GitHub App</SubHeader>

The first step is to install the QA Wolf GitHub App on the repository (repo) you want to test.

Make sure you are on your <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/tests" target="_blank">test dashboard</a>, looking at the group you want to test on deployment. Open the trigger dropdown and click on the button to "Add GitHub repo".

You will be redirected to GitHub and asked to choose the repo(s) you want QA Wolf to access.

Choose the repo(s) you want to test and click the green "Install" button. After the installation succeeds, you will be redirected back to QA Wolf.

<SubHeader>Trigger Tests on Netlify Deployment</SubHeader>

Open the trigger dropdown again. This time, you will see the repo(s) you installed listed. Click on the option to run on your repo's deployment.

  width={400}
/>

A popup will appear asking which tool you use to deploy. Make sure Netlify (the default option) is selected and click the "Save" button.

<SubHeader>Update Tests to Use Deploy Preview URL</SubHeader>

Because our Netlify Deploy Preview URL isn't known in advance, QA Wolf passes it as an <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment variable</Link> (`process.env.URL`) when a Deploy Preview succeeds.

We need to update our tests to use this environment variable when specified.

Replace the URL in your tests with `process.env.URL`. For example, let's say our test currently starts with:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto("https://default.netlify.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

Let's update the `page.goto` call to go to `process.env.URL` if it exists, and our default URL otherwise:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
// go to process.env.URL if specified, and the default URL otherwise
await page.goto(process.env.URL || "https://default.netlify.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

<SubHeader>See QA Wolf Results in GitHub</SubHeader>

Now when you make a pull request on GitHub, your tests will run after your Netlify Preview Deploy succeeds.

<SubHeader>Conclusion</SubHeader>

Now that our tests run on Netlify deployments, let's <Link href="send-slack-alerts">alert our team</Link> when they fail.
