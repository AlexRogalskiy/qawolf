<Header>Run Tests with CLI</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll trigger our tests with the QA Wolf CLI. This is useful if you want to run your tests in a CI provider like <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</ExternalLink> or <ExternalLink href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</ExternalLink>.

<SubHeader>Create API Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="when we call the QA Wolf CLI" />

Select the "API" tab on the right.

  width={488}
/>

You can rename your trigger, or keep the default name ("API" in our example). If you have created <Link href="use-environment-variables">environments</Link>, you will also need to select one for your trigger.

  src="/docs/run-tests-with-api/choose-environment.png"
  width={486}
/>

You'll notice the second gray box provides an example of how to use the QA Wolf CLI. Copy this example as we'll use it later. Don't worry, you can always access it again by editing the trigger.

Once you are done, click the "Create trigger" button to save your trigger.
