<Header>Run Tests on Vercel Deployment</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll set up our tests to run when <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments" target="_blank">deploys</a> our site. This helps ensure our critical workflows don't break when we make changes.

<SubHeader>Create Deployment Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="on Vercel deployments" />

Click this button to open a popup with options to create a trigger.

Select the "Deployment" tab in the middle, and choose Vercel as your deploy service. You can also optionally rename your trigger.

/>

Now we'll connect our GitHub repository (repo) to QA Wolf. Click the "Connect GitHub repository" button to get started.

  width={400}
/>

A new tab will open and visit GitHub. You will be asked to choose the repo(s) you want QA Wolf to access.

<Image

  width={400}
/>

Choose the repo(s) you want to test and click the green "Install" button. After the installation succeeds, the new tab will close.

Confirm the repo you want to test is now selected in the dropdown.

### Choose Deployment Type

Vercel has <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#deployment-types" target="\_blank">two types of deployments</a>: **production** and **preview**. Production deployments happen when you merge to your production branch or run the `vercel --prod` command. Preview deployments are all other deployments, like deployments of commits in a GitHub pull request.

QA Wolf allows you to run your tests on all deployments (preview and production), just preview deployments, or just production deployments. Choose which deployments you want to test in the popup. In our example, we choose to only test preview deployments:

  width={488}
/>

### Choose Branches (Optional)

You can also optionally specify which GitHub branches your tests should run on.

For example, at QA Wolf we have a group of tests that we run when staging is deployed. We deploy to staging automatically when we merge to the `develop` branch.

If you only want your tests to run on specific GitHub branches, choose "Select" under the GitHub branches option. You will be prompted to list these branches in an input. Enter a comma-separated list of branches like `develop,main`.

  width={488}
/>

### Choose Environment

If you have created any <Link href="use-environment-variables">environments</Link>, choose the one to use when your tests run.

<Image
  alt="Choose environment"

  width={489}

Press the "Create trigger" button to save your new trigger. ðŸŽ‰

<SubHeader>Assign Deployment Trigger to Test</SubHeader>

<AssignTrigger doc="run-tests-on-vercel-deployment" />

<SubHeader>Update Tests to Use Deployment URL</SubHeader>

Because our Vercel deployment URL isn't known in advance, QA Wolf passes it as an <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment variable</Link> (`process.env.URL`) when a deployment succeeds.

We need to update our tests to use this environment variable when specified.

Replace the URL in your tests with `process.env.URL`. For example, let's say our test currently starts with:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto("https://default.vercel.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

Let's update the `page.goto` call to go to `process.env.URL` if it exists, and our default URL otherwise:

```js
const { context } = await launch();
const page = await context.newPage();
// go to process.env.URL if specified, and the default URL otherwise
await page.goto(process.env.URL || "https://default.vercel.app/", {
  waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
});
```

<SubHeader>See QA Wolf Results in GitHub</SubHeader>

Now when you make a pull request on GitHub, your tests will run after your Vercel deployment succeeds.
