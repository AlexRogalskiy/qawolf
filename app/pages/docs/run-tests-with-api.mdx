<Header>Run Tests with API</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll run our tests by calling the QA Wolf API.

<SubHeader>Run Tests by Calling QA Wolf API</SubHeader>

<ApiExample />

The API call makes a `POST` request to the `/suites` endpoint. It includes a few parts:

- The required <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization">Authorization header</ExternalLink> provides your team's API key: `-H "Authorization: API_KEY_HERE"`.
- The optional `tags` string is a comma separated list of test tag names: `"tags": "Checkout,Sign up"`. If not provided, all of your tests will run. Otherwise, tests with any of the provided tags will run.
- The optional `environment` string is the name of the <Link href="use-environment-variables#create-an-environment">environment</Link> to use when running your tests: `"environment": "Staging"`. If you have multiple environments and do not provide an `environment`, QA Wolf will error and ask you to specify an environment.
- The optional `variables` object in the request body provides <Link href="use-environment-variables">environment variables</Link> to your tests: `"variables": { "MY_VARIABLE": "secret" }`. If any variables share names with variables in your environment, the passed variables will override those values.

If you paste this command into your terminal and run it, you'll get a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "suiteId",
  "url": "https://www.qawolf.com/suites/suiteId"
}
```

The `id` returned is the id of your new suite. The `url` links to the results page for your tests.
