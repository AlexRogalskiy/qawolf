<Header>Run Tests on a Schedule</Header>

In this tutorial, we'll schedule our tests to run every day. This helps ensure our critical workflows are not broken.

<SubHeader>Create Schedule Trigger</SubHeader>

<CreateTrigger description="every day" />

Clicking this button opens a popup with options to create a trigger. Make sure you are on the "Schedule" tab.

You can rename your trigger, or keep the default name ("Daily" in our example).

Next choose whether you want your tests to run every day or every hour. If you have created <Link href="use-environment-variables">environments</Link>, will also need to select one for your trigger.

Once you are done, click the "Create trigger" button to save your trigger.

<SubHeader>Assign Schedule Trigger to Test</SubHeader>

Now that we've created our trigger, let's assign it to a test. You can assign triggers to tests any time by clicking the "Edit triggers" button in the top right corner of the editor, or by selecting tests in the dashboard.

The checkboxes indicate whether a trigger is assigned to the selected tests. Clicking on this checkbox will toggle whether the trigger is assigned to your test.

When you are done, click the "Done" button to close the popup.

You can also edit or delete triggers by hovering over them and clicking the relevant button.

<SubHeader>View Run History</SubHeader>

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - now your tests will run every day!

You can see your test runs in the "Run history" page of the <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/suites" target="_blank">dashboard</a>.
