<Header>Convert Actions to Code</Header>

In this guide, we dive a bit deeper into how QA Wolf converts your actions to code.

You'll learn how to toggle auto code creation on and off. You'll also learn how QA Wolf chooses selectors and about best practices for front end code.

<SubHeader>Toggle Code Creation</SubHeader>

As you use your site, QA Wolf converts your actions to <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/core-concepts" target="_blank">Playwright</a> test code. You can turn auto code creation on or off depending on your needs.

In the top right corner of the test editor, there is a toggle in the "Code" tab. When this toggle is set to on, it has a magic wand icon. This means that when you use your site, your actions will be converted to test code.

  src="/docs/convert-actions-to-code/create-code-toggle.png"
  width={1600}
/>

When the create code toggle is set to on, you'll notice that the comment below is added to your test code:

```js
// üê∫ create code here
```

This comment tells QA Wolf where to insert new test code. If you want to insert test code in a different place (like in the middle of your test), move this comment where you want the new test code to go.

If you delete the `// üê∫ create code here` comment, you'll notice that the code create toggle is set to off. Turn the toggle on again to add this comment back to your code.

Clicking on the toggle also turns off auto code generation. When code creation is turned off, the toggle has a pause icon. Now when you use your site, your actions will **not** be converted to test code.

  width={1076}
/>

You can turn code creation on and off as much as you like.

One caveat is that code generation does not work while a test is running. QA Wolf will wait until your test passes or fails before converting additional actions to code.
